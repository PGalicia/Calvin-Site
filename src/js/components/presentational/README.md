components/presentational folder will hold all "aesthetic" components (ie whatever the users see)

### Key Notes:

- Logics are not allowed in presentational components, except styling logic.
  - Styling logic example: background color will change once a button is pressed
  - Non-styling logic example: information will be send to the backend once a button is pressed
